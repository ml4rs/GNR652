In this course, students will learn a breadth of topics from basics to many state of the art machine learning techniques in the literature. The students are expected to have taken a first course in Linear Algebra and Statistics to better understand the course content. Content and Syllabus TBA Updates 16/01 : Lecture on 17/02 will be a hands on session on Julia taken by Saurabh; do bring your laptops along. Session handout is now available in the schedule tab. 6/02 : Lecture on 7/02 will be a revision and hands on session on Linear Regression taken by Saurabh. Session materials are now online. 10/02 : We will have a demo presentation from AWL Inc, Japan of their video surveillance product in the last 30 minutess of the the lecture on 11/02. 11/02 : Tutorial 1 is available on schedule tab and Moodle. 12/02 : Assignment 1 is available on schedule tab and Moodle.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#machine-learning-for-remote-sensing","text":"Instructor : Prof. Biplab Banerjee Type : Graduate Elective Course Prerequisites : A First course in Linear Algebra and Statistics When : 19:00-20:30 on Tuesdays and Fridays at LA 001 Teaching Associate : Saurabh Kumar Moodle link : GNR652","title":"Machine Learning for Remote Sensing"},{"location":"#overview","text":"This is a fundamentals on machine learning course motivated via applications to Remote Sensing and Satellite Image Analysis.
